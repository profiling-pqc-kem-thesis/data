Percentages are based on the number of instruction fetches reported by Callgrind.

When creating two keypairs and performing encryption and decryption (roundtrip), `poly_Rq_mul` is responsible for 43.18% of the instruction fetches.

The performance of the HRSS and HPS variant (in this context) was found to be virtually the same, hence the graphs only reflect one of the variants (NTRU HRSS 701).
